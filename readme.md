# AsyncStorage React Native

AsyncStorage is an unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app.

It should be used instead of LocalStorage.

It is recommended that you use an abstraction on top of AsyncStorage instead of AsyncStorage directly for anything more than light usage since it operates globally.
